I created a tic tac toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I programmed the game logic using conditional statements to determine when a player wins or the game results in a tie.The game starts by prompting the player to enter their name under where it says "Player 1/2", then pressing "Enter". This project showcases my ability to use JavaScript to create interactive and dynamic games!
